# Introduction

Back in april 2021 I created my own template for Microsoft Dynamcis 365 Business Central with its own CICD process based on [Freddys blogpost](https://freddysblog.com/2020/11/14/using-github-for-devops/). Since then I build my first Github Action and used the template for all my projects.

# AL.Template

You can find my template repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliandittmann/AL.Template).

# "Run-alpipeline" GitHub Action

You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliandittmann/run-alpipeline).


# A better way

Now it's 2022 already and my template is already outdated ;)
